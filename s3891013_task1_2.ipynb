    "<ol>\n",
    "<li><b>Nature of Salary Determination:</b> In the real world, salaries often vary based on job categories. For instance, positions in IT or finance might generally command higher salaries compared to roles in hospitality or retail. By grouping on Category, we're leveraging this natural structure in the job market.</li>\n",

    "<li><b>Homogeneity Within Groups:</b> While the overall dataset might show weak correlations, within specific job categories, salaries might be more consistent or homogeneous. By imputing based on category medians, we're drawing from a more specific and relevant subset of the data.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><b>Preserves Data Distribution:</b> Unlike replacing all zero salaries with a global median or mean, group-based imputation maintains the original distribution of salaries within each category. This helps in preserving the inherent patterns and variances in the dataset.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><b>Robustness to Outliers:</b> Median, as a measure of central tendency, is more robust to outliers than the mean. So, if a particular job category has a few exceptionally high or low salaries, using the median will ensure that the imputed values are not skewed by these outliers.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><b>Categorical Nature of the Dataset:</b> Given that most of the dataset's features are categorical, techniques that rely on correlations or linear relationships (like regression imputation) might not be as effective. Group-based imputation capitalizes on the categorical nature of the data, making it more suitable for this dataset.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering these reasons, imputing zero salaries based on the median salary of their respective Category is a logical and effective approach for this dataset.\n",
